# Bench My Salary

## This is a full-stack web application built with Next.js, Node, Typescript PostgreSQL, and more.

This web application is an app that lets developer enter their salary and see some data analysis on how their salary entry compares to the rest of the market (fictitious dummy data).

Users can enter their salary and their job function details

After entering their salaries users get several graphs and data analysis results about their entry.
Showcasing how they compare to the market using Chart.js

This project was built by me (Ravid) as part of my final project of the full-stack web development bootcamp.
I enjoyed building this project as I like discussing the job market, salaries, recruiting, etc.
Also, I like it when websites show graphs, it is easier to convey a point with graphs.

The project is meant to run on a desktop, and although most of the pages are responsive and fit mobile devices, the graph page was tricky therefore that's the only page that is not responsive.

This project is deployed to Vercel with a DB.

I have used PostgreSQL to create the DB on my machine and used AI to generate the dummy data so there is enough data to analyze and show in graphs.

I tried to get a good combination of male and female ratios, different seniority levels, different industries, and job functions (frontend dev, backend dev, full-stack dev, etc...).

My next step is to try to implemnt a chatbot.
